# odin-recipes

This is my first ever project!

The project is to create a recipe website using HTML
Using the HTML boilerplate to set up the the page properly
Learning from The Odin Project about HTML Foundations and demonstrating what I have learned so far
Such as usings tags and elements for: 
Working with text on the page using paragraphs, headings, bold, italics and comments
Using lists, ordered and unordered lists
Creating links and images by using anchor elements and the href attribute to draw absolute and relative links, as well as using the img element with the src attribute and an alt for if the image doesn't work.
Making short concise and active git commits that are easy to read and understand
