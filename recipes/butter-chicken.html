    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, 
            and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine cream, tomato sauce, remaining butter, 
            salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala in a saucepan over medium-high heat; 
            bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, 
            stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.
        </li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. 
            Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 
            about 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
