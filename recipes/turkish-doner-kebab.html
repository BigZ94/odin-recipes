    <h2>Recipe for an authentic Turkish Doner Kebab</h2>

    <p>This is one of my go to munches when nothing else can satisfy the hunger.
        Maybe it's because I love meat so much in general but a good bit of lamb 
        when cooked right is *chefs kiss* <em>delicious</em>.
    </p>

    <p>This should be a relatively easy recipe which is a bonus.
        For those of you who love getting take-out, try this take out at home 
        and you will not regret it
